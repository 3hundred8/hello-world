# hello-world
My first repository

Hello everyone! I'm Marius, currently somewhere between studying, finding myself and electronic music. 
I also like Cryptocurrencies and the technology behind blockchain based assets. 
I'm an XRP and XLM enthusiast and really interested in learning soem basic coding. The future is digital 
and I think it is always great to go with the time. 

I love mexican, thai, sushi, indian and every other cuisine that is not neccessarily based on meat. 

Fuck racism, fuck inequality and fuck selfishness!
